A leaflet demonstration using IPL data

This is my first work with Leaflet, I hope it is satisfactory. I thank Skylark Drones for giving me this opportunity.

I have used data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) showcasing the following on a map of India:
1. Current Teams, home city, IPL track record
2. Former Teams, home city, IPL track record
3. Other stadium venues where IPL matches have been held.

I was trying to use PHP to add more leaflet markets based on user input, using 2 form types:
1. New Stadium
2. New Team
But I failed in this endeavour. I am continuing to work on this front. 
I am also trying to use the javascript innerhtml feature, but to no avail so far.

I plan to use Angular JS to update stats on the leaflet popup.

I shall update the code when I am done with that, but please accept this as the complete product for the time being. Thank you.
